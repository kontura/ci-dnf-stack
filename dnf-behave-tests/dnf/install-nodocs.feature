Feature: install command on packages and their docs


Scenario: Install a documentation package from local repodata
Given I use repository "microdnf-install-nodocs"
 When I execute dnf with args "install man-pages"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And transaction is following
      | Action        | Package                                   |
      | install       | man-pages-0:4.16-3.fc29.x86_64            |
